# hangman-game-
Hangman game created using python 311. Created as my first independent project in my freshmen year.
If you decide to try out this game you will need to download dictionary.txt, main.py, and rules.py. 
Also needed is Python 3.11 to be able to run the files
Make sure all three downloaded files are in the same location for it to work properly
